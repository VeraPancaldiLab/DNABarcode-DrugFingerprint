  abstract = {Cellular DNA barcoding has become a popular approach to study heterogeneity of cell populations and to identify clones with differential response to cellular stimuli. However, there is a lack of reliable methods for statistical inference of differentially responding clones. Here, we used mixtures of DNA-barcoded cell pools to generate a realistic benchmark read count dataset for modelling a range of outcomes of clone-tracing experiments. By accounting for the statistical properties intrinsic to the DNA barcode read count data, we implemented an improved algorithm that results in a significantly lower false-positive rate, compared to current RNA-seq data analysis algorithms, especially when detecting differentially responding clones in experiments with strong selection pressure. Building on the reliable statistical methodology, we illustrate how multidimensional phenotypic profiling enables one to deconvolute phenotypically distinct clonal subpopulations within a cancer cell line. The mixture control dataset and our analysis results provide a foundation for benchmarking and improving algorithms for clone-tracing experiments.},

Since its first discovery in 2009, studies based on scRNA-seq provide massive information across different fields making exciting new discoveries in better understanding the composition and interaction of cells within humans, model animals and plants. In this review, we provide a concise overview about the scRNA-seq technology, experimental and computational procedures for transforming the biological and molecular processes into computational and statistical data. We also provide an explanation of the key technological steps in implementing the technology. We highlight a few examples on how scRNA-seq can provide unique information for better understanding health and diseases. One important application of the scRNA-seq technology is to build a better and high-resolution catalogue of cells in all living organism, commonly known as atlas, which is key resource to better understand and provide a solution in treating diseases. While great promises have been demonstrated with the technology in all areas, we further highlight a few remaining challenges to be overcome and its great potentials in transforming current protocols in disease diagnosis and treatment.},

Cellular barcoding can be used to track millions of cells in parallel, and thus is an efficient approach for investigating heterogeneous populations of cells. Over the past 25 years, cellular barcoding has been used for fate mapping, lineage tracing and high-throughput screening, and has led to important insights into developmental biology and gene function. Driven by plummeting sequencing costs and the power of synthetic biology, barcoding is now expanding beyond traditional applications and into diverse fields such as neuroanatomy and the recording of cellular activity. In this review, we discuss the fundamental principles of cellular barcoding, including the underlying mathematics, and its applications in both new and established fields.},

We show that elevating barcode insertion probability, and thus increasing the average number of barcodes within the cells, adds to the number of traceable lineages but decreases the accuracy of lineages’ inference due to reading errors. We discuss how this tradeoff informs optimal experimental design under different constraints and limitations. In particular, we explore the trade-off between accuracy and the number of traceable lineages, concerning limited resources, the cells and barcode pool features, and the dropout probability.},

However, the data produced by these screens are noisy, and many effects may go undetected. Here we introduce transcriptome-wide analysis of differential expression (TRADE)—a statistical model for the distribution of true differential expression effects that accounts for estimation error appropriately. TRADE estimates the ‘transcriptome-wide impact’, which quantifies the total effect of a perturbation across the transcriptome. Analyzing several large Perturb-seq datasets, we show that many transcriptional effects remain undetected in standard analyses but emerge in aggregate using TRADE. A typical gene perturbation affects an estimated 45 genes, whereas a typical essential gene affects over 500. We find moderate consistency of perturbation effects across cell types, identify perturbations where transcriptional responses vary qualitatively across dosage levels and clarify the relationship between genetic and transcriptomic correlations across neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Despite an increased awareness of the problematic of cell line cross-contamination and misidentification, it remains nowadays a major source of erroneous experimental results in biomedical research. To prevent it, researchers are expected to frequently test the authenticity of the cell lines they are working on. STR profiling was selected as the international reference method to perform cell line authentication. While the experimental protocols and manipulations for generating a STR profile are well described, the available tools and workflows to analyze such data are lacking. The Cellosaurus knowledge resource aimed to improve the situation by compiling all the publicly available STR profiles from the literature and other databases. As a result, it grew to become the largest database in terms of human STR profiles, with 6,474 distinct cell lines having an associated STR profile (release July 31, 2019). Here we present CLASTR, the Cellosaurus STR similarity search tool enabling users to compare one or more STR profiles with those available in the Cellosaurus cell line knowledge resource. It aims to help researchers in the process of cell line authentication by providing numerous functionalities. The tool is publicly accessible on the SIB ExPASy server (https://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus-str-search) and its source code is available on GitHub under the GPL-3.0 license.},

  abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments frequently encounter batch effects that can significantly distort biological interpretations, particularly in complex, multifactorial studies where biological variables interact with experimental batch conditions. Existing batch correction tools primarily address technical variability and often neglect these critical interaction effects, resulting in incomplete adjustments. To address this gap, we introduce DESeq2-MultiBatch, a novel, lightweight batch correction method implemented entirely within the DESeq2 analytical framework. Unlike conventional approaches, DESeq2-MultiBatch directly leverages DESeq2’s internal model estimates to correct raw gene count data, accurately adjusting for experimental batch effects, including interactions with biological variables. Here, we demonstrate that DESeq2-MultiBatch effectively mitigates batch-related variability while preserving genuine biological differences. Benchmarking against widely used methods highlights DESeq2-MultiBatch as a robust, practical solution for improving exploratory data visualization and downstream analyses in multifactorial RNA-seq studies.

  abstract = {Tumours are often composed of a multitude of malignant clones that are genomically unique, and only a few of them may have the ability to escape cancer therapy and grow as symptomatic lesions. As a result, tumours with a large degree of genomic diversity have a higher chance of leading to patient death. However, clonal fate can be driven by non-genomic features. In this context, new technologies are emerging not only to track the spatiotemporal fate of individual cells and their progeny but also to study their molecular features using various omics analysis. In particular, the recent development of cellular barcoding facilitates the labelling of tens to millions of cancer clones and enables the identification of the complex mechanisms associated with clonal fate in different microenvironments and in response to therapy. In this Review, we highlight the recent discoveries made using lentiviral-based cellular barcoding techniques, namely genetic and optical barcoding. We also emphasize the strengths and limitations of each of these technologies and discuss some of the key concepts that must be taken into consideration when one is designing barcoding experiments. Finally, we suggest new directions to further improve the use of these technologies in cancer research.},
